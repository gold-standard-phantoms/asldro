Series Type: ASL
-----------------

The full ASL generation pipeline, comprises of constructing a time-series of m0, control and label volumes
with perfusion signal generated by the General Kinetic Model, which is then encoded into
gradient or spin echo contrast, motion is optionally applied, and an image is acquired at the
specified acquisition resolution.

All strings are case-insensitive, for example "pcasl", "pCASL" and "PCASL"
are all valid.

Images generated by the ASL pipeline will be stored in a subdirectory names "perf".

All parameters have defaults if omitted; the default parameters result in a "White Paper"
style acquisition:

* pCASL, 1.8s label duration, 1.8s PLD.
* One M0, one Control and one Label volume.
* SNR 1000 (this results in a perfusion signal SNR of ~10).
* Acquisition matrix of [64, 64, 40], gives a voxel size of ~[3.1, 3.6, 4.7] mm
* Background suppression applied to the Control and Label volumes, with pulse times optimised
  for the T1 values in the ground truth, based on four pulses and a saturation time of 3.9
  seconds, however the actual saturation time is 4.0 seconds to ensure all
  magnetisation is positive. 


Single or Multiphase ASL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Single or multiphase ASL data can be generated using the parameter :ref:`signal_time<signal-time>`, depending
on the values supplied:

* If ``signal_time`` is a single value, then single phase ASL data  will be generated in
  accordance with the volumes in :ref:`asl_context<asl-context>`, i.e. a single post
  labelling delay.
* If ``signal_time`` is an array of values, then multiphase ASL data will be generated, where
  a set of volumes according to :ref:`asl_context<asl-context>` will be generated for
  each value of ``signal_time``, i.e. a set of data for each post labelling delay. These 
  images will be 

In the ASL series pipeline, ``signal_time`` is iterated over in the outer loop,
and ``asl_context`` is iterated over in the inner loop. All images are concatenated
into a single 4D timeseries in the order of acquisition. For example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "series_type": "asl",
        "series_description": "multiphase asl",
        "series_parameters": {
            "label_duration": 1.0,
            "signal_time": [1.0, 1.25, 1.5],
            "asl_context": "control label"
        }
    }

Will produce a 4D timeseries with volumes in this order:

#. control, PLD = 0.00s
#. label, PLD = 0.00s
#. control, PLD = 0.25s
#. label, PLD = 0.25s
#. control, PLD = 0.50s
#. label, PLD = 0.50s



.. _signal-time:

:signal_time: (float or array, optional) The time in seconds after labelling 
    at which the ASL signal should be generated. Note that this is equal to the 
    ``label_duration`` + Post Label Delay, however the latter is not a defined
    input parameter. Defaults to ``3.6``.


Single value parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following parameters are applied to every volume that is generated by the DRO.

:label_type: (string, optional) Defines the type of ASL labelling: "pcasl", "casl" or "pasl".
    See :class:`.GkmFilter` for implementation details. Defaults to ``"pcasl"``.
:label_duration: (float, optional) The temporal duration in seconds of the labelled bolus of blood.
    Defaults to ``1.8``.
:label_efficiency: (float, optional): The degree of inversion of the magnetisation by the labelling
    pulses. Defaults to ``0.85``.
:acq_matrix: (array of integers, optional) A 3-entry array defining the acquisition matrix size
    [Ni, Nj, Nk]. Defaults to ``[64, 64, 20]``.
:interpolation: (string, optional) The type of interpolation to use when resampling the 'acquired'
    image. See :class:'.ResampleFilter' for implementation details. Can be:

    :'continuous': order 3 spline interpolation
    :'linear': order 1 linear interpolation
    :'nearest': nearest neighbour interpolation

    Default value for an asl image series is ``"continuous"``.

:acq_contrast: (string, optional): Defines the MRI signal model to use. "ge" for Gradient Echo,
    "se" for Spin Echo.  See :class:`.MriSignalFilter` for implementation details. Defaults to ``"se"``.
:desired_snr: (float, optional) The signal-to-noise ratio of the acquired image. Note this is the 
  base SNR of the image, not the SNR of the perfusion signal. A value of approximately 100 is comparable
  to the sort of SNR in a single ASL control-label pair. If this has value of 0, then no noise
  will be added. See :class:`.AddComplexNoiseFilter` for implementation details. Defaults to
  ``1000.0``, which provides acceptable SNR for a single subtraction.
:random_seed: (int, optional) Seed to control the determinism of any pseudo-random behaviour
  in the pipeline, for example the noise added to images. Defaults to ``0``.
:output_image_type: (string, optional) Specifies the image type of the output image: "magnitude", 
  "complex". Defaults to ``"magnitude"``.
:background_supppression: (object or boolean, optional) Defines whether background suppression is
  used. Background suppression comprises of a saturation pulse followed by multiple inversion
  pulses with inversion times chosen so that the magnetisation of tissues with different T1's are
  nulled at the point that the imaging excitation pulse is played out. Can take the form:
    
    :true: Background suppression is used, with the default parameters.
    :false: No background suppression is used.
    :object: An object with key/value pairs defining parmaeters for the 
      background suppression.
  
  The default value for ``background_suppression`` is:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
        "sat_pulse_time": 4.0,
        "sat_pulse_time_opt": 3.9,
        "pulse_efficiency": "ideal",
        "num_inv_pulses": 4,
        "apply_to_asl_context": ["label", "control"]
    }

**Background Suppression Parameters**

Below are the valid background suppression parameters for when an object is used as the value
for the parameter key ``background_suppression``. For more information about the 
implementation of background suppression see :class:`.BackgroundSuppressionFilter`. Note that
due to the way these parameters are validated, the values returned if an empty object
is provided for the parameter ``background_suppression`` will differ
to those listed in the default value above. Instead they will take the defaults listed
below.

:sat_pulse_time: (float) The time in seconds between the saturation pulse and
    the imaging excitation pulse. Defaults to ``4.0``.
:inv_pulse_times: (array of floats, optional) Array of the inversion times for each inversion
    pulse. Defined as the spacing between the inversion pulse and the imaging 
    excitation pulse in seconds. If omitted then optimal inversion times will be
    calculated.
:pulse_efficiency: (string or float, optional) Defines the efficiency of the excitation pulse.
    Can take the values:

    * "realistic" Pulse efficiencies are calculated according to a model based
    on their T1.
    * "ideal" Inversion pulses are 100% efficient.
    * A numeric value between -1.0 and 0.0, inclusive, explicitly defining
    the inversion efficiency. -1.0 is full inversion, and 0.0 is no inversion.
    
    The default value is "ideal".

:t1_opt: (array of floats, optional) The T1 relaxation times, in seconds, to optimise
    the inversion times for. If omitted then the unique T1 values in the ground truth
    image for T1 will be used.
:sat_pulse_time_opt: (float, optional) If present, this value will be used in the
    pulse timing optimisation. This enables the use of a slightly longer ``sat_pulse_time``,
    to ensure that the magnetisation is positive at the point of excitation. If omitted
    then ``sat_pulse_time`` will be used for the optimisation (default)
:num_inv_pulses: (int) The number of inversion pulses to generate optimised times for.
    Defaults to 4.
:apply_to_asl_context: A list defining which asl contexts should have background 
    suppression applied for. The entries can either be ``"control"``, ``"label"``,
    or ``"m0scan"``. Defaults to ``["label", "control]``.
