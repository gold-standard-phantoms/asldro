Development
===========

Development of this software project must comply with a few code styling/quality rules and processes:

* Pylint must be used as the linter for all source code. A linting configuration can be found in ``.pylintrc``. There should be no linting errors when checking in code.
* Before committing any files, `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ must be run with the default settings in order perform autoformatting on the project.
* Before pushing any code, make sure the CHANGELOG.md is updated as per the instructions in the CHANGELOG.md file.
* The project's software development processes must be used (`found here <https://confluence.goldstandardphantoms.com/display/AD/Software+development+processes>`_).
