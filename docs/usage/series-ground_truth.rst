Series Type: Ground Truth
--------------------------

The ground truth pipeline simply resamples the input ground truth images to a specified
resolution.  Individual NIFTI images are output for each ground truth quantity in the input image.

All parameters have defaults if omitted; the default parameters result no motion and a resampled
matrix of [64, 64, 40].

Images generated by the Ground Truth pipeline will be stored in a subdirectory names "ground_truth".

Single value parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following parameters are applied to every volume that is generated by the DRO.

:acq_matrix: (array of integers, optional) A 3-entry array defining the acquisition matrix size
    [Ni, Nj, Nk]. Defaults to ``[197, 233, 189]``.
:rot_z: (float, optional) Rotation of the ground truth model in world space about the
    z-axis in degrees. See :class:`.TransformResampleImageFilter` for implementation details.
    Defaults to ``0.0``.
:rot_y: (float, optional) Rotation of the ground truth model in world space about the
    y-axis in degrees. Defaults to ``0.0``.
:rot_x: (float, optional) Rotation of the ground truth model in world space about the
   x-axis in degrees. Defaults to ``0.0``.
:transl_x: (float, optional) Translation of the ground truth model in world space along the
    x-axis in mm. Defaults to``0.0``.
:transl_y: (float, optional) Translation of the ground truth model in world space along the
    y-axis in mm. Defaults to ``0.0``.
:transl_z: (float, optional) Translation of the ground truth model in world space along the
    z-axis in mm. Defaults to ``0.0``.
:interpolation: (array of strings, optional) The type of interpolation to use when resampling the
    'acquired' image. The first entry defines the type of interpolation for all ground truth volumes
    except for the ``"seg_label"`` volume. The second entry is the interpolation type for
    the ``"seg_label"`` volume. See :class:'.ResampleFilter' for implementation details. Each entry
    can be:

    :'continuous': order 3 spline interpolation
    :'linear': order 1 linear interpolation
    :'nearest': nearest neighbour interpolation

    Default value is ``["linear", "nearest"]``
