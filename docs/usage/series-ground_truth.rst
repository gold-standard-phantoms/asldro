Series Type: Ground Truth
=========================

The ground truth pipeline simply resamples the input ground truth images to a specified
resolution.  Individual NIFTI images are output for each ground truth quantity in the input image.

All parameters have defaults if omitted; the default parameters result no motion and a resampled
matrix of [64, 64, 12].

Images generated by the Ground Truth pipeline will be stored in a subdirectory names "ground_truth".

Single value parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following parameters are applied to every volume that is generated by the DRO.

:acq_matrix: (array of integers, optional) A 3-entry array defining the acquisition matrix size
    [Ni, Nj, Nk]. Defaults to ``[197, 233, 189]``.
:rot_z: (float, optional) Rotation of the ground truth model in world space about the
    z-axis in degrees. See :class:`TransformResampleImageFilter` for implementation details.
    Defaults to ``0.0``.
:rot_y: (float, optional) Rotation of the ground truth model in world space about the
    y-axis in degrees. Defaults to ``0.0``.
:rot_x: (float, optional) Rotation of the ground truth model in world space about the
   x-axis in degrees. Defaults to ``0.0``.
:transl_x: (float, optional) Translation of the ground truth model in world space along the
    x-axis in mm. Defaults to``0.0``.
:transl_y: (float, optional) Translation of the ground truth model in world space along the
    y-axis in mm. Defaults to ``0.0``.
:transl_z: (float, optional) Translation of the ground truth model in world space along the
    z-axis in mm. Defaults to ``0.0``.
